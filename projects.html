 <h2>Projects</h2>
 <p>
 I believe in Free Software, so I run several software projects which have
 been released under Free Software licenses.
 </p>

 <h3>AgenDAV</h3>
 <p>
 AgenDAV is a CalDAV web client built on top of free software. At the moment
 of starting its development (May of 2011) there were no other free CalDAV
 web clients, so I started this one.
 </p>

 <p>It has lots of features, including:</p>

 <ul class="square">
   <li>Drag&amp;Drop interface</li>
   <li>Multilanguage and timezones support</li>
   <li>Multiple calendars</li>
   <li>Configurable calendar colours</li>
   <li>Calendar sharing</li>
 </ul>

 <p>
 It just requires a working CalDAV server (e.g. <a
 href="http://www.davical.org/">DAViCal</a>, <a
 href="http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/">SabreDAV</a>, <a
 href="http://trac.calendarserver.org/">Calendar and Contacts Server</a>,
 etc)
 </p>

 </p>

 <h3>Consigna</h3>
 <p>
 Consigna is a file sharing web application created to make easier sending
 files to other people without using large email attachments.
 </p>

 <p>
 Main features are:
 </p>

<ul class="square">
 <li>Clean interface</li>
 <li>Progress bar while uploading a file</li>
 <li>Password protected files</li>
 <li>Users can manage their own uploaded files</li>
 <li>Automatic file expiration</li>
 <li>Files are scanned by ClamAV antivirus</li>
</ul>

<p>Consigna is currently being used at some public institutions and
companies in Spain. Some of them are:</p>

<ul class="square">
 <li><a href="https://consigna.us.es/">University of Seville</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://consigna.uca.es/">University of Cádiz</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://consigna.uhu.es/">University of Huelva</a></li>
 <li>Sevilla City Council</li>
 <li>Public Company for Agricultural and Fisheries development
 (Andalusia)</li>
 <li>Reina Sofia Public Hospital (Córdoba, Andalusia)</li>
 <li>Other companies which asked to be kept anonymous</li>
</ul>

of Seville software forge</a> (temporary location, pending move to Github).
Unfortunately is only available in Spanish right now.</p>

<h3>libopensso</h3>

<p>The University of Seville had a long Sun software background, so they
wanted to use OpenSSO (formerly known as <em>Sun Access Manager</em>) as
their Single Sign-On solution.</p>

<p>There was no easy way to set up SSO authentication on applications
without messing with Apache buggy modules, so I wrote a PHP helper for
PHP applications that makes using the SSO a trivial task.</p>

<p>First version of this library was really rudimentary, but I have
rewritten it to make it totally OOP and it's now a <a

href="http://packagist.org/packages/us/libopensso">Composer package</a>.</p>
