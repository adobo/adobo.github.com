     <h2>Who am I?</h2>
     <p>I'm a freelancer from Spain who does web development (mostly
     backend) and system administration. <tt>zsh</tt> and <tt>vim</tt> are
     my main tools. I'm available for <a href="/hire">hire</a>.</p>
     
     <p>Using GNU/Linux and free software since 2001.</p>

     <p>I love fountain pens.</p>
     
     <h2>Why adobo.org?</h2>

     <p>Adobo is the Spanish word for <em>marinade</em>, which is a condiment
     suitable for meat, fish and some other foods. I like the taste of
     adobo, and I enjoy giving food names to my machines and personal
     projects.</p>
