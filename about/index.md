Hi! I'm Jorge López Pérez. I live in Spain.

System administration and programming are both my profession and my hobby. I have a <a
href="{{ site.github }}">GitHub account</a>, where you will find some of my work on Free Software.

I have been using GNU/Linux systems for a long time, and I love fiddling with other *nix flavours as well. `zsh` and `vim`
are my main working tools. PHP is generally my language of choice for web backends.

You can contact me at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.

You can also find me at twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/jorgelzpz/">@jorgelzpz</a>.

I'm available for consulting, so feel free to contact me and tell me your needs.  I have worked with a variety of
systems, so my skill set covers a wide range of technologies, and I'm willing to learn new things every day.
